> A modular, AI-driven Arch Linux configuration system with Claude integration

## Project Overview

TheArchHive is an experimental, AI-assisted framework for Arch Linux that brings the power of Claude directly into your system configuration workflow. It creates a seamless integration between your Neovim environment and AI assistance, allowing you to configure, optimize, and share your Arch Linux setup with unprecedented ease.

Built around a constellation of modular components, TheArchHive enables a collaborative ecosystem where AI can provide contextual recommendations based on your system's actual state and the collective wisdom of the Arch community.

## Key Features

- **Claude in Neovim**: Chat with Claude directly in your editor
- **System-Aware AI**: Claude can access your system information to provide contextual advice
- **Model Context Protocol**: A bridge connecting Claude to your Arch system
- **System Snapshots**: Capture and share your configurations in a standardized format
- **ClaudeScript**: A universal language for encoding system configurations
- **Minimal Footprint**: Designed with Arch's minimalist philosophy in mind

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Arch Linux or compatible distribution
- Git
- Python 3.6+
- Neovim 0.5+
- An Anthropic API key for Claude

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TheArchHive.git
cd TheArchHive

# Run the installation script
./install.sh

# Set up Claude API integration
./scripts/setup-claude.sh

# (Optional) Set up the MCP server
./scripts/setup-mcp.sh
```

## Usage

### Claude in Neovim

- Open Neovim and press `<Space>cc` to launch Claude
- Ask questions about your system, packages, or configurations
- Get contextual recommendations based on your actual setup

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

- Start the MCP server: `python scripts/mcp_server.py`
- The server provides system information to Claude
- Allows Claude to execute approved commands with your permission

### System Snapshots

- Create a snapshot of your system: `./scripts/snapshot.sh`
- Snapshots are stored in ClaudeScript format for easy sharing
- Use snapshots to recreate configurations or share with others

## Roadmap

TheArchHive is under active development. Here's what we're working on:

### Phase 1: Core Integration (Current)
- âœ… Claude in Neovim implementation
- âœ… Basic system snapshot tool
- ðŸ”„ Model Context Protocol server
- ðŸ”„ ClaudeScript language fundamentals

### Phase 2: Enhanced System Integration
- ðŸ”œ Version control for configurations
- ðŸ”œ Command execution framework
- ðŸ”œ Enhanced system monitoring
- ðŸ”œ Configuration backup and restore

### Phase 3: Community Features
- ðŸ”œ Snapshot sharing mechanism
- ðŸ”œ Community recommendation engine
- ðŸ”œ Configuration templates
- ðŸ”œ Package optimization suggestions

### Future Possibilities
