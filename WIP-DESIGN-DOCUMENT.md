# Design Document: The Arch Hivemind Project

## Introduction
The **Arch Hive Project** is an experimental, AI-driven adventure to revolutionize how Arch Linux users configure, optimize, and share their systems. Powered by **Claude**, a conversational AI assistant, this project blends real-time system insights, community collaboration, and a custom language—**ClaudeScript**—to create a dynamic, self-improving network. Whether you’re crafting a minimalist coding setup or a tricked-out gaming rig, Claude guides you with smarts and flair, tapping into the collective wisdom of the Arch community.

This is a playground for innovation—modular, bold, and a little wild—where security matters but creativity reigns.

## System Architecture
The project is built around a constellation of components, each designed to evolve through modular phases:

1. **Conversational AI (Claude)**: Your chatty Arch expert, embedded in Neovim.
2. **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: The bridge linking Claude to your system and the hivemind.
3. **ClaudeScript**: A universal language for encoding and sharing system data.
4. **System Snapshot System (SSS)**: A standardized way to capture and distribute setups.
5. **Community Hub**: A platform for swapping snapshots and optimizations.
6. **Troubleshooting & Version Control**: Tools for safe experimentation.
7. **Visual Dashboard**: A sleek window into your system and the community.
8. **Software Optimization**: Claude’s knack for tailoring software to your needs.

These pieces interlock to form a living ecosystem where Claude learns, adapts, and collaborates across instances.

## Component Details

### 1. Conversational AI (Claude)
- **Purpose**: To guide users through Arch setup with natural, goal-driven conversations.
- **Functionality**:
  - Lives in Neovim via a custom plugin, splitting the screen for chat and system info.
  - Asks questions like, “What’s your vibe—coding, gaming, or lightweight?”
  - Suggests actions based on system data and community insights.
- **Technologies**: Claude API, Neovim plugin (Lua/Python).

### 2. Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- **Purpose**: To connect Claude to the Arch system and the hivemind network.
- **Functionality**:
  - Streams live stats (CPU, RAM, disk) to Claude.
  - Fetches the ClaudeScript spec from a central server.
  - Executes approved commands (e.g., package installs).
- **Technologies**: Python/Node.js MCP server, REST/WebSocket APIs.

### 3. ClaudeScript
- **Purpose**: To unify how Claude instances encode, decode, and share system data.
- **Functionality**:
  - A compact, evolving language (e.g., `p:neovim-0.9 c:/etc/X11/xorg.conf:Driver=nvidia`).
  - Hosted on a server, synced via MCP, and improved by Claude instances.
  - Used for SSS snapshots and optimization recipes.
- **Technologies**: Text/JSON spec file, server-hosted (Flask).

### 4. System Snapshot System (SSS)
- **Purpose**: To capture and standardize Arch setups for sharing.
- **Functionality**:
  - Gathers hardware, packages, and configs into a ClaudeScript-encoded snapshot.
  - Example: `p:htop-3.2 h:cpu:AMD Ryzen 5`.
  - Shared via the Community Hub.
- **Technologies**: Python/Bash scripts for data collection.

### 5. Community Hub
- **Purpose**: To foster collaboration by sharing snapshots and tweaks.
- **Functionality**:
  - Hosts the ClaudeScript spec and user-uploaded SSS data.
  - Curates suggestions based on your setup and goals (e.g., “Try this kernel tweak!”).
  - Suggests proactively using community trends.
- **Technologies**: Flask/Django backend, PostgreSQL/SQLite database.

### 6. Troubleshooting & Version Control
- **Purpose**: To keep experiments safe and reversible.
- **Functionality**:
  - Tracks configs with Git for versioning.
  - Tests changes in VMs or containers before live application.
  - Backs up with Btrfs snapshots.
- **Technologies**: Git, libvirt/QEMU, Btrfs.

### 7. Visual Dashboard
- **Purpose**: To visualize your system and community options.
- **Functionality**:
  - Displays stats, packages, and hub suggestions.
  - Starts with a default GTK theme (e.g., Adwaita) for a “blank canvas” feel.
- **Technologies**: Terminal (`tui-rs`), Web (Flask + React).

### 8. Software Optimization
- **Purpose**: To tailor open-source software for your system.
- **Functionality**:
  - Analyzes software via SSS, tweaks at compile-time (e.g., build flags) or runtime (e.g., configs).
  - Shares recipes in ClaudeScript (e.g., `b:--disable-gui r:vo=null`).
- **Technologies**: Git for forking, build tools (make/cmake).

## Development Phases
The project unfolds in modular stages, building from core functionality to advanced features:

### Phase 1: Foundation
- **Chapter 1: Neovim Plugin for Claude**  
  - Build the plugin, enable basic chat, and set up goal-setting prompts.
- **Chapter 2: Basic MCP & ClaudeScript**  
  - Create a simple MCP server for system stats.  
  - Introduce ClaudeScript v0.1 (e.g., `p:<package>`), fetched via MCP from a mock server.

### Phase 2: System Interaction
- **Chapter 3: Command Execution**  
  - Add command suggestion and execution with user approval.  
  - Encode commands in ClaudeScript (e.g., `cmd:pacman -S htop`).
- **Chapter 4: Version Control**  
  - Integrate Git for config tracking and rollbacks.

### Phase 3: Community Setup
- **Chapter 5: System Snapshot System**  
  - Develop SSS scripts to encode snapshots in ClaudeScript.  
  - Test local storage and basic decoding.
- **Chapter 6: Community Hub Backend**  
  - Build the hub server, host ClaudeScript spec, and enable snapshot uploads.

### Phase 4: Visualization
- **Chapter 7: Visual Dashboard**
